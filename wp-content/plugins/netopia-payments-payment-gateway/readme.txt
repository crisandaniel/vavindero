NETOPIA Payments Payment Gateway extends WooCommerce payment options by adding NETOPIA's Payment Gateway options.

== Description ==

NETOPIA Payments Payment Gateway extends WooCommerce payment options by adding NETOPIA's Payment Gateway options.

= Features: =

* **100% FREE TO USE** (GPLv2 license).
* Integrates NETOPIA payments' card and cryptocoin payments service with your WordPress + WooCommerce online shop. SMS and Wire transfer options are still under development.
* Accepts payments with Visa and Mastercard credit/debit cards
* Handles IPN responses and automatically changes order status on your shop in real time (confirmed/paid or failure messages and refunds).

= Requirements: =
Please note that **on first update** your `private.key` and `public.cer` could be removed and **the plugin might need to be reconfigured**!
* PHP 7+
* openssl and dom extensions

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly (recommended) or upload `netopiapayments` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory using your favourite FTP client.

2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.

3. Configure your settings under `WooCommerce > Settings > Checkout > NETOPIA Payments` option panel: enable the payment gateway and test mode, fill in your Seller Account ID (get it from your Netopia account under Admin - Seller accounts - Edit - Security settings) and select at least one payment option (usually Credit Card).

4. Upload your live `private.key` and `public.cer` files from your NETOPIA merchant account. These certificates should look like this: `live.XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXprivate.key` and `live.XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.public.cer`. Don't rename `.key` and `.cer` files and make sure that `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` matches your Seller Account ID! 

5. For testing purposes you will also need your sandbox keys to be uploaded into the plugin. Synchronize your seller account in Admin - Seller accounts - Edit - Synchronize and then access sandbox through Implementation - Test the implementation. Once in sandbox, download the certificates from Admin - Seller accounts - Edit - Security settings). They should look like this: `sandbox.XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXprivate.key` and `sandbox.XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.public.cer`. Don't rename `.key` and `.cer` files and make sure that `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` matches your Seller Account ID!

6. With test mode enabled contact NETOPIA's support team to test the configuration. Send your shop URL to implementare@netopia.ro and ask for your account to be tested and activated for live mode.
